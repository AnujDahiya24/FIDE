# üìö Introduction 

The thirds step has us scraping a table of FIDE Country Codes from this [URL](https://www.olimpbase.org/help/help41.html). This is a handy table to convert the `Country` column values over to more interpretable values in Step 4. In hindsight, I could have saved myself some time by looking at this [link](http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/palview/p3manual/p3flags.htm) within the URL I linked above.

If you want to: 

1. View the table, see the `Country Data` hyperlink below.
2. View/Run the program, see the scraping `Tutorial` below.
