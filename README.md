This repository is to help all chess players utilize and work with [public chess profile data](http://ratings.fide.com/download_lists.phtml) provided by the `FIDE` organization (through December 2019). FIDE's website can be cumbersome to work with and has limited visuals about chess players. My hope is that this project helps users avoid the pain of using their website and provide interesting insights to the chess community.

The project is divided into 6 steps, which are outlined [here](https://github.com/AnujDahiya24/FIDE-Chess-Data#-lifecycle-of-data).

# üìà Dashboard

To see ratings in real-time, I've created a dashboard to help chess players [here](https://anujdahiya24.shinyapps.io/apps/).

# üó∫Ô∏è Where is the data?

The data is located in this [folder](https://github.com/AnujDahiya24/FIDE-Chess-Data/tree/master/Chess%20Scripts/Step%204%20-%20Cleaning/Cleaned%20csvs).

The folder contains over a hundred `.csv` files, from January 2001 to December 2019, that can be analyzed.

If you have suggestions on different data formats you'd like, please state them in [Issues](https://github.com/AnujDahiya24/FIDE/issues).

Other than that, feel free to use it as you see fit.

# ‚ôüÔ∏è Why did I do this?

I chose to work on this project because of several reasons:

- FIDE's publically available data is in an unorganized layout. There is no "download all datasets" button to acquire all of their data. FIDE also doesn't publically list data prior to February 2015 on the new download page when there is actually data going back as early as 2001. As a result, site visitors may find FIDE's website frustrating to work with and I wanted to help overcome their struggles.

- Chess players like to see visuals of themselves, friends, competitors, top players and players across various demographics. I wanted to provide these visuals.

- I wanted to improve my skills in 2 programming languages.

- I've always taken an interest in any data about chess that has not been extensively analyzed. My curiosity drives me.
